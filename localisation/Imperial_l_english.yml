 imperial_interceptor_tech_research: "Interceptor Technology Research"
 laat_equipment_desc: "The LAAT was a heavily armed troop transport, capable of clearing a landing zone with it’s 360 degree field of fire, as well as being able to defend itself from enemy air attacks. It was capable of transporting up to three squads of troopers, or up to four speeder bikes; an incredible boost to mobility for our ground army, which currently lacks any form of quick transport."
 maat_equipment_desc: "The MAAT was the Imperial evolution of the LAAT, with increased armor to enable a greater survivability; a common problem of the late LAAT. The MAAT was in all respects capable of anything that the LAAT was able, but to more extremes; being able to land in nearly any weather and even move to the outer atmosphere of a planet. This will do well, as we can reach an elevation to high for enemy anti aircraft weaponry to target our craft until the moment we descent."
 idt_equipment_desc: "The Imperial Dropship Transport was in all respects, an imperialized version of the earlier LAAT platform. Its design was intended to be more aggressive to the enemy, while being smaller and more nimble to avoid enemy interception and fire once it began its descent. As we move to take on opponents fielding larger air wings, this will be a necessary advantage to increase the survivability of our landing troopers."
 tie-rp_equipment_desc: "The TIE Reaper was a dropship featured in the TIE series of Imperial starfighters, taking on the iconic paint scheme and solar wings. It took many design considerations from the TIE Striker, specifically built for operations within the atmosphere of a planet. It functions similarly to a fighter, with its speed being greater than any aircraft fielded by the natives of this planet; allowing for us to more rapidly deploy and wreak havoc among our enemies battle lines."
 tie-rb_equipment_desc: "The TIE/RB was designed as a heavy support craft, featuring an extra pod housing two external laser cannons to provide heavy firepower to ground and air targets. A droid brain controlled the secondary turrets, allowing the pilot to more easily fly the craft and control the main weapons."
 aal_equipment_desc: "The Atmospheric Assault Lander was a heavily armored transport intended for use in situations of heavy enemy fire. It came equipped with a deflector shield generator in order to further protect the occupants until the moment of landing, as well as a dedicated weapons system for clearing the immediate area around the landing zone and supporting disembarking troopers. A heavy lander is exactly what we require, as our enemies continue to develop heavier guns capable of destroying our previous models."
 torrent_equipment_desc: "The V-19 was the mainstay of the Republic Starfighter Corps for good reason; it was cheap to produce and was an effective all around fighter and light air support. It had folding wing foils for added maneuverability, as well as two laser cannons on each wing tip and six concussion missiles. It works well in atmosphere as well, a fact we will take advantage of as our need for a cheap, easily produced starfighter becomes more apparent."
 z-95_equipment_desc: "The need for a craft more adequate at dealing with enemy aircraft is clear, and our solution is the Z-95 Headhunter. As we draw nearer to our goal of producing our own TIE series starfighters draws closer, we must produce a fighter capable of holding off enemy craft until then. Armed with two triple laser cannons and two concussion missile launchers, the Z-95 is capable of annihilating enemy aircraft with extreme lethality, yet at the cost of maneuverability. It will prove capable in a limited role, providing much better ground support than its predecessor."
 tie-sf_equipment_desc: "The TIE/SF was a further improvement upon the earlier TIE/LN starfighter, with a crew of two for increased efficiency in weapon control. It featured a rotating twin laser cannon and variable warhead launcher as well as the standard two laser cannons, allowing it to fire at targets both in front and behind simultaneously. A significant improvement upon an iconic design, one we are going to use extensively. "
 y-wing_equipment_desc: "The BTL was the workhorse of the Republic navy, being an effective bomber for years after its evolution into the Empire. Armed with a variety of loadouts from ion cannons to concussion missiles, they are a versatile, survivable starfighter to serve our needs of a dedicated bomber."
 skipray_equipment_desc: "The Skipray was a capable bomber, technically classed as a capital ship due to its immense power output. It was armed with three ion cannons capable of stopping the nervous system of any living being hit directly by the blast, a tractor beam capable of stopping some craft mid air, two laser cannons, and a proton torpedo launcher. It was less maneuverable, however when used in a bomber capacity and escorted properly, it was an incredibly effective ground strike craft."
 scimitar_equipment_desc: "The Scimitar Assault Bomber was the final evolution of the TIE bomber series, featuring 16 separate missile racks capable of targeting multiple targets simultaneously; the unprecedented firepower carried within the Scimitar allow for us to use a single starfighter to decimate an entire enemy armored spearhead."
 tie-in_equipment_desc: "The TIE Interceptor was the logical successor to the V-Wing in the TIE series. It was faster, more heavily armed, and capable of withstanding blows that would have destroyed the lightly armored V-Wing. With six total laser cannons able to fire simultaneously on the same target, no craft will be able to withstand a pass from our iconic, deadly starfighter."
 tie-sk_equipment_desc: "The TIE Striker was a dedicated atmospheric fighter, able to perform significantly better than other interceptors or fighters due to not being required to be able to go into the depths of space. Armed with six laser cannons and a proton bomb launcher, it was capable of shredding air opponents and never being hit. Truely a fearsome sight in the skies, the Striker will be a welcome addition to our growing arsenal."
 tie-vn_equipment_desc: "The TIE Vengeance was one of the fastest starfighters available, easily overwhelming lesser pilots leading to crashes. Featuring shields, six laser cannons, and two concussion missile launchers, this starfighter was a terror in the skies. It is also capable of foiling enemy sensors, allowing it to remain undetected until a pilot or ground crew can directly see it. This evolution is the next iteration of the Imperial Air Corps."
 tie-ba_equipment_desc: "The TIE Baron was similar to the Vengeance, equipped with a hyperdrive and a new paint scheme deviating from the standard Imperial grey. This was a tactic intended to enrage our enemies, taunting them with a target they can never hope to match."
 arc-170_equipment_desc: "The ARC-170 was an incredible fighter/bomber, capable of holding its own in a firefight as well as providing ground support in an equal capacity. It was equipped with two medium laser cannons and proton torpedoes as its primary offensive suite, with a twin laser cannon in a ball turret on its rear in order to provide improved defense. Its heavier shields compared to that of other starfighters in its class allow it to survive incredible amounts of damage. This is the perfect starfighter to keep up with the increasing needs of air support by the Imperial Army."

 #descriptions
 spha_equipment_desc: "The SPHA was a heavy artillery vehicle bearing a modular weapon mount, allowing it to be adapted to a variety of combat situations. Its main weapon was typically a starship level turbolaser, capable of tremendous destructive power. The primary disadvantage of this weapon however was that it required line of sight to the target, a large drawback compared to the indirect fire of traditional artillery. This will still suit our need for heavy firepower however, until we are capable of developing further artillery."
 spma_equipment_desc: "The SPMA-T was an advanced self propelled artillery piece, armed with a variable trajectory turbolaser. This allowed it to not only change the angle of fire, but also the power of the projectile fired; this allowed it to adapt to whatever the current target may have been. The range it is capable of will be an incredible boon to our ground assaults, as we will no longer require a line of sight to our targets in order to be within range of firing."
 infantry_support_platform_desc: "The ISP sacrifices reconnaissance for firepower and survivability, something we must prioritize in these harsh times while we reorganize our forces. It will allow us to harass our enemies with hit and run tactics, while also providing forward intelligence to our frontline commanders. "
 barc_equipment_desc: "The BARC was a versatile speeder used by the late Galactic Republic, able to have a variety of attachments and weapons added onto it as the situation evolved. This will be useful to us, as reconnaissance is vital to our army in order to be able to effectively perform combat operations, which the BARC excels at. "
 ava_equipment_desc: "The 614 is a measurable improvement over the BARC, offering greater maneuverability and speed at the loss of modularity. It is significantly easier to use for our pilots, as well as easier to maintain and store as it can fold in on itself, allowing it to be stored inside of other transport vehicles and be deployed where necessary, or even carried in the field by troopers to be deployed at their discretion."
 z_speeder_equipment_desc: "The 74-Z is the speeder used by the Reconnaissance Troopers of the rest of the Empire for good reason, as it is the fastest speeder available while still being safe to pilot for our pilots. It also comes equipped with adequate firepower to harass light enemy formations and fortifications while allowing for our own troopers to return safely with any intelligence that they may have gathered while on mission."
 atrct_equipment_desc: "The AT-RTC was a variant of the AT-RT specialized in urban suppression, with a height tall enough to see over large crowds and multiple rotating blaster cannons intended for crowd suppression. This walker will suit us well in quelling any regions with a particularly large resistance to Imperial occupation."
 atap_equipment_desc: "The AT-AP was a multi-purpose walker designed for fire support against armored enemy targets during the Clone Wars. It used a large caliber mass driver cannon as its main armament, allowing it to inflict greater damage upon heavily armored vehicles. The gun generated incredible recoil, so much so that a third leg was required to be deployed when firing to stabilize itself. The issue compounded, as continuous firing required that its firing mechanisms be replaced often due to the recoil generated."
 av7_equipment_desc: "The AV-7 was a dedicated anti vehicle cannon mounted on a repulsorlift chassis, making it capable of rapid deployment in the field. The only thing capable of stopping the tremendous firepower output from the cannons is a shield, something our enemies have no access to. No enemy armor can withstand our superior firepower."
 atot_equipment_desc: "The AT-OT was a heavily armored, yet open topped, vehicle used for transporting large amounts of cargo and troops across long distances. It was armed with four laser cannons, however rarely saw combat as it was used to quickly transport large numbers of troops around the battlefield to handle combat. It is an old design, but reliable; it shall serve us well in moving our stormtroopers across large battlefields in intense combat situations."
 rtt_equipment_desc: "The RTT was an incredibly fast troop transport, able to hold its own in combat as well if supported. It featured two laser cannons as well as two mass driver missile launchers, however its light armor limited its role to ferrying troops rather than a direct firesupport tank. Its speed will allow us to move quickly into and out of combat situations and perform a variety of maneuvers around enemy formations before they are able to react."
 itt_equipment_desc: "The ITT is the logical combination of its predecessors, combining speed with armor and fighting capacity. It is able to withstand more damage than the RTT, while having greater firepower. It is faster than the AT-OT, and cheaper to produce while still being able to transport a limited number of troopers into battle. This will do us well seeing as how our enemies are developing larger guns capable of more destructive firepower."
 itc_equipment_desc: "The ITC is a wheeled counterpart to the ITT, offering a better experience for its crew with more space and accommodating controls. It has a 360 degree twin laser cannon turret mounted on its top, allowing for the gunner to hit targets regardless of the vehicle's orientation. It is also raised further from the ground to help avoid enemy mines and other ground ordinance, a problem found in previous vehicle designs."
 juggernaut_equipment_desc: "The Juggernaut is an older design from the days of the Republic, but possibly one of the most complex and heavily armored ground vehicles in the Imperial Army. It boasts the capacity to hold an immense number of troopers, while being able to fend off enemy armored targets as well as aircraft while taking no damage itself. It is incredibly costly, but even a few dispersed amongst our armored battalions will turn the tide of battle hastily."
 mauler_equipment_desc: "The Mauler was an attempt to utilize the TIE platform in a ground vehicle role, sharing many of the same components of its starfighter counterparts. It was equipped with three repeating laser cannons for shredding lightly armored targets and capable of incredible speed, however it too shared the drawbacks of all early TIE craft, no shielding and a weak structure not capable of withstanding heavy enemy fire. This is a stepping stone on the path to a heavier craft, but still useful nonetheless."
 crawler_equipment_desc: "The Crawler was the more successful TIE ground platform, featuring heavier armor and improved weapons. It had dual medium laser cannons for dealing with nearly all targets, and a retractable light turbolaser capable of blasting away heavy enemy fortifications with ease. This craft will suit our needs for a fast, heavy vehicle that is able to advance behind enemy lines or support our own troopers by destroying enemy field fortifications."
 px_equipment_desc: "The PX-10 was well suited for providing armored support for Imperial garrisons where enemy resistance was not expected to be extreme. It was a single man tank, armed with a single medium laser cannon capable of destroying enemy armored targets with ease. Its armor made it impervious to enemy small arms fire, and even a variety of anti tank weaponry. This is the perfect platform for helping to secure our growing territory."
 h_repulsor_equipment_desc: "The 1-H is a sidestep in our progress, as it uses similar concepts to the Saber platform. It is armed to deal with large amounts of lightly armored targets at once, with rotating turrets capable of firing in all directions. It has no shields, but is heavily armored, making it resistant to anything except more dedicated anti tank weapons. It is however prone to breaking down in bad weather conditions, something that has frequently been mentioned by its crews."
 atm6_equipment_desc: "The AT-M6 was developed alongside the First Order AT-AT as a more heavily armed variant, boasting a full turbolaser cannon on its back to provide firepower capable of destroying entire bunkers, and anything else in its path. It also had larger feet to allow increased stability when walking on unstable terrain, essentially preventing it from being toppled. Mass deployment of walkers of this caliber will ensure our absolute victory, with no enemy capable of withstanding firepower from even a lone walker."
 rx_equipment_desc: "As we push into enemies with a significant air presence, we require dedicated anti air weapons for when we cannot maintain an air presence over every battalion in our army. The RX-200 is an excellent candidate for the position, as it uses a heavy ship based ion cannon to disable all electrical systems in an enemy plane (and potentially the nervous system of its pilot) in a split second. This will be a wonderful tool for disabling enemy high altitude bombers that most guns would be incapable of reaching."
 ataa_equipment_desc: "The AT-AA was a far cry from its predecessor in that it utilized a fast firing flak missile system to target multiple enemy aircraft at once rather than single targets. It provides a significant advantage in firepower, and is also capable of inflicting more destruction upon ground targets. A perfect multiuse tool to support our troopers against threats from above and at ground level."

 atte_equipment_desc: "The AT-TE was a successful multirole walker utilized extensively during the Clone Wars as an anti vehicle and infantry platform. Unlike later designs, the AT-TE was low to the ground with six legs in order to achieve incredible stability, as well as to provide redundancy in the event one leg was to be destroyed during combat. The largest feature was its ability to climb vertical surfaces, allowing any combination of tactics for surprise tactics or ambush opportunities. This walker will be well suited until we are able to get accustomed to this planet, as it provides a quality basis with which to further our ambitions."
 atdp_equipment: "AT-DP"
 atdp_equipment_desc: "The AT-DP was the successor to the AT-PT, improved in many ways. It’s biggest advantage over its predecessor was an upgraded blaster cannon, capable of piercing heavier armor while still being protected from any small arms. It was also significantly taller, allowing its heavier cannon to fire at a longer distance with fewer obstacles in its path. This will do perfectly compared to the lightly armored resistance we find ourselves pitted against, as well as demoralize enemy ground infantry."
 atpt_equipment: "AT-PT"
 atpt_equipment_desc: "The AT-PT allows us to make a single trooper into a walking weapons platform from which our standard troopers can rally and advance with.

 elite_atat_equipment: "AT-AT"
 elite_atat_equipment_desc: "The Imperial AT-AT could be felt coming before it could be seen, a feature deliberately used to demoralize enemy opposition; something that sometimes made them retreat before combat even began. Its armor could only be pierced by heavy weapons mounted on starfighters, or vehicles intentionally armed with weapons capable of piercing armor such as found on the AT-AT. This will be a wonderful war machine for ruining our enemies, one that our troopers will be delighted to see once again."
 fo_atat_equipment: "First Order AT-AT"
 fo_atat_equipment_desc: "The AT-AT could further be improved upon by strengthening the armor on its underside and sides to protect against enemy artillery and aircraft bombing, as well as infantry charging the underside. "

 Tarkin_desc: "Wilhuff Tarkin is one of the most powerful individuals in the Galactic Empire, a Grand Moff who shaped Imperial doctrine and was the driving force behind the creation of its key embodiment, the Death Star. Born on Eriadu to the powerful and militaristic Human Tarkin family, the ambitious Tarkin began his career by serving in the Republic Outland Regions Security Force. He then retired and entered politics, becoming lieutenant governor of Eriadu and the Seswenna sector, before returning to the military in order to serve Supreme Chancellor Palpatine as an agent of the secret Sith Lord's New Order movement."
 Vader_desc: "Now in possession of a great amount of power, Vader began settling into his position as Palpatine's enforcer. However, several members of the Empire viewed Vader as being mad human wreckage. Although in possession of great wealth, Vader allowed himself few comforts. Among those were his personal retreat on Coruscant and Bast Castle on Vjun. The 501st Legion, the stormtrooper division he led in the extermination of the Jedi at the Jedi Temple, became his personal guard. The actions they undertook in Vader's name over the course of the Civil War earned them the nickname of 'Vader's Fist'."
 Malsuum_desc: "Due to his abandonment during battle, Hock hated the Jedi. During the Clone Wars, he had considered them to be fearless warriors, but believed others could be fearless even without a lightsaber, and that even Jedi could make mistakes. He acknowledged the fact that he was created by the Kaminoans for a purpose, and could take pride in that. He also believed he was a machine with unlimited replacements, meaning that each was equally unimportant. He also considered that he was trained to fight well. To him, loyalty is a choice, and was loyal to Darth Vader and the Empire until the hospital massacre. During the Shrouded Offensive, he saw Vader do unspeakable things, and knew that the lack of humanity would haunt his memory. He then realized his respect for the warrior had been misplaced."

 imp_exploitation_desc: "While having the capacity to build many weapons at once is wonderful, we lack the raw materials to do so. Many of our factories sit idle as they await shipments of material to work with, wasting valuable time. There are many displaced laborers, out of work due to Imperial mining machines replacing them at their job. We can use them as cheap labor to provide a boost to our resource extraction output."
 imp_new_headquarters: "New Headquarters"
 imp_new_headquarters_desc: "Constructing a new headquarters with which to base ourselves from would allow for increased work efficiency for our men, as working from the Executor gives a feeling of only being on this planet temporarily.

The Empire stands unconquerable, and will do so for a thousand years."
 imp_increased_autonomy: "Increased Autonomy"
 imp_increased_autonomy_desc: "Allowing our Senate to be the controllers of the citizens will allow our higher staff to focus on military matters, which was their original role before being forced into the role of bureaucrat after being stranded.

 imp_the_senate: "The Senate"
 imp_the_senate_desc: "Appointing a Senate will allow for our citizens to have a voice in our policy, however the Senate will ultimately still be under our control if the public were to vote in an unfavorable way.

 imp_gulf_city: "New Coruscant"
 imp_gulf_city_desc: "New Coruscant, our growing metropolis to the west of the crash site, is becoming a major hub of activity in this region of the world.

It also housed the structural plans for the ship, as well as technical plans for the majority of our starfighters and walkers aboard. Restoration will be a long process, but a necessary one."
 imp_technology_for_our_subjects_desc: "Allowing limited amounts of our arms to be reproduced by those we have puppeted will allow for them to keep pace with our own troopers in the field instead of lagging behind struggling to keep up with our rate of advance. Even our older models will be an incredible boost to the strength of their forces."

 imp_battlefront_assault_desc: "Intermixing transports to quickly move troopers around the battlefield with heavy walkers to clear a path will result in a deadly combination of firepower and maneuverability that our enemies cannot hope to cope with."
 imp_mobile_imperial_army_desc: "Light Walkers have served the Imperial Army well, moving with infantry advances to provide additional firepower and support, as well as covering fire so our men can move onto the enemy position while they are taking cover."
 imp_study_kuat_corporation_practices_desc: "Kuat is responsible for Imperial Walker production, and remain at the forefront of Imperial design. Retaining their practices will allow us to quickly adapt to our changing situation and further our already advanced Walker designs."
 imp_kuat_light_vehicles_desc: "Using practices derived from Kuat, we can improve our own walkers by ourselves. Improving the quality of our walkers instead of focusing on improving production will aid us more in the future, as a walker still standing after a battle is more important than one left destroyed."
 imp_stick_with_what_works_desc: "Utilizing older designs we can begin production of walkers sooner rather than later, still allowing us to provide our troops with armored support; albeit not the walkers our troopers are accustomed to seeing."

 imp_walkers_in_every_battalion_desc: "Making sure every trooper deployment also has walker support will ensure that we have adequate support, as our enemies cannot hope to withstand our combined arms when deployed in numbers. A single walker is not a threat, but a squadron is unstoppable."
 imp_reinstate_heavier_models_desc: "Using heavier walkers alongside our troopers on foot will allow for our army to slowly but surely roll over our enemies, laying waste to any obstacles in their path. Our superior firepower will annihilate our enemies."
 imp_war_doctrine_refinement_desc: "Planning our assaults in greater detail will allow our tank crews to take greater advantage of their armor and speed by detailing missions behind enemy lines to cut off and surround pockets of men, allowing our regular forces to move in and wipe them out."
 imp_bomber_models_desc: "Bombers are a particularly important tool we must utilize, as our enemies have no chance of gaining air superiority over us as it stands. If we focus on our bomber effort, we can destroy any land opposition we come across with ease."
 imp_simple_roles_desc: "By simplify using our bombers in a single role, bombing, we can focus on increasing their destructive capacity. Previously, bombers have been outfitted with a variety of laser weaponry, turrets, and other various additions. Bombers have one job, dropping ordnance on the enemy, and this is what we must focus on."
 imp_blanket_the_skies_desc: "Our starfighters are unique in their design compared to the inhabitants of this world, making an iconic impression on those that see them. If we produce them in large quantities, our already iconic starfighters will strike fear into the hearts of our enemies. They will fear the howl of our ion engines."
 imp_research_on_bomber_construction_desc: "Instead of using outdated models, we should turn our attention to the future; we should strive to develop new methods with which to wage war. Newer bombers will be faster, more defensible, and deliver a much more destructive blow to its targets."
 imp_fewer_accidents_desc: "By retraining our pilots, as well as training new pilots, to operate in this planets particular atmosphere, we can reduce the number of accidents and increase the effectiveness of our already capable starfighter corps."
 imp_the_ultimate_fighter_desc: "Focusing our efforts on a craft capable of outperforming any of its counterparts while doing the job of all of them sounds like a ludicrous opportunity, one which we should seize on. There has been a craft in the works of the Imperial Air Corps for a long time which we may complete, allowing us an incredible boon to our wings."
 imp_transportation_and_support_desc: "Gunships are an incredible boost to our ground troops firepower and morale, a battalion of men in the field and surrounded by the enemy will rejoice when they see a gunship loaded down with food and ammunition, blazing a path to their position. We must invest into their development."

We must invest into their development."
 imp_improved_gunship_turrets_desc: "Improving the turrets on our existing and future models to allow a wider firing arc lets our gunships focus more on flying the correct course instead of aligning the ship to allow gunners to fire at the enemy, making both of their roles easier to fulfil. Further armoring of gun positions also allows our gunners to survive a direct hit from enemy attacks and continue firing, greatly increasing survivability."
 imp_simplify_assembly_process_desc: "As it stands, gunships are a time intensive craft to make. Simplifying this process will allow us to create more, which we desperately need in order to keep up with our growing ground forces."
 imp_a_rain_of_fire_desc: "Having double, even triple, the standard amount of gunships per trooper deployment will be an incredible boost to the destructive capability our ground forces are able to inflict, no enemy can withstand a barrage of rockets and laser cannon fire that a squadron of our gunships are capable of outputting."
 imp_land_air_cooperation_desc: "By assigning our gunships to our ground commanders rather than our Imperial Air Corps, we can allow our commanders to use them at their own discretion rather than having to place a request for support."
 imp_air_doctrine_refinement_desc: "Focusing on destroying our enemies capacity to fight will cripple their front line troops, as if we destroy the factories, we destroy our enemies ability to arm its own men. Nothing can withstand the firepower of the Imperial Air Corp."
 imp_research_lab_construction_desc: "Compared to our enemies, we are on an entirely different level of warfare. Our technological advantage is so extreme, even our most basic equipment is lightyears ahead of anything else we may encounter by the natives of this world.

 light_equipment_desc: "Both Walkers and Speeders share the Light Brigade Unit type. 'Walkers' function the same way that 'Light Tanks' do. However, they have more armor and speed. Speeders work as a poor-man's light tank, easy to produce in numbers but incredibly vulnerable. The 'Speeder' can be mixed in with 'Walkers' to essentially create cheap light tank units at the cost of efficiency, or you could have a light brigade full of speeders to move at incredible speeds. These Vehicles are best paired with Armored Transports."
 heavy_equipment_desc: "Heavy Walkers such as AT-AT's and AT-TE's function similar to Super Heavy Tanks without the Terrain Penalties. As a result they are much more expensive resource wise to produce. These kinds of vehicles best fit with stormtrooper/blaster units."

 imp_restore_weapon_systems: "Restore Weapon Systems"
 imp_restore_weapon_systems_desc: "Rebuilding our main weapons will be a top priority, as the Executor was at one time the most well armed ship in the entire Imperial Navy. Focusing on the concussion missiles will aid us greatly, as their range is enough to cover a wide radius around the ship."
 imp_gun_modifications_one: "Assault Concussion Missle"
 imp_gun_modifications_one_desc: "Further recovery of our munitions stockpiles that remain unexploded after the crash allows us to use the best missiles available, as some are not entirely intact and have exploded mid flight."

 imp_complement_land_1: "Walker/Tank Support"
 imp_complement_land_1_desc: "With our prefabricated garrisons there were also large numbers of ground vehicles stored in a nearby hangar. With time and effort, we could begin to clear the rubble and salvage what vehicles we can. It is likely a number of vehicles survived due to their high durability, and location of the hangar."
 imp_complement_land_2: "Walker/Tank Production"
 imp_complement_land_2_desc: "Much like our TIEs, our walkers and tanks are another necessary component of the Imperial Army. Without armored support, our troopers would be left vulnerable! We must use our current models and increase production."

 imp_take_afg: "Take Afghanistan"
 imp_take_afg_desc: "Afghanistan will give us a small amount of strategic resources that are vital to us, as well as more manpower with which to use in our future efforts. Taking them isn’t vital, but it is a viable option for expansion."
 imp_protect_per: "Invite Persia"
 imp_protect_per_desc: "Inviting Persia with a promise of 'Independence' will be a thinly veiled threat, enough to make them likely cave to us."
 imp_integrate_per: "Integrate Persia"
 imp_integrate_per_desc: "Iran is a poor nation with little in developed infrastructure, it is necessary for us to build it from the ground up in order to be able to supply our troops in the region."

 imp_special_forces2_desc: "Combing through the ranks of our standard troopers and selecting the men best fit, we can bolster our own specialized troopers ranks with the best of the best we have to offer, with the best equipment in the Imperial Army at their disposal."
 imp_recruitment_drive: "Recruitment Drive"
 imp_recruitment_drive_desc: "Broadcasting Imperial propaganda across all forms of wireless media across the globe will surely draw in recruits from the farthest reaches of this planet. Setting up recruitment centers in Operational Base Besh will allow us to use our secret police to filter out candidates who are deemed ‘undesirable.’"

The former Imperial Galactic Marines are the closest equivalent we have to men experienced with naval invasions upon enemy shores giving us a basis with which to begin developing our own specialized divisions for assaulting enemy waters."
 imp_mountaineers_desc: "Mountains are one of the most common obstacles we face in the surrounding terrain. Developing further specialized equipment is a high priority, as gaining every advantage we can and sparing our manpower is vitally important to our survival."
 imp_paratroopers_desc: "Utilizing our superior aircraft is another area in which we should pay extra focus, as our enemies cannot hope to keep up with or shoot down our fighters or transports. Using aerial assault tactics we can drop behind enemy lines and disrupt their supplies, or take entire cities with little resistance while their men are on the front lines."

 info.0.a: "Ok!"
 imperial_story.0.t: "Introduction"
 imperial_story.0.d: "After taking the nearly completed Super Star Destroyer Executor for a test flight accompanied by many high ranking officials in the Imperial Army and Navy, catastrophe struck. What was supposed to be a many hour jump through hyperspace to allow the guests aboard to take a grand tour, the ship suddenly lurched out of hyperspace into the gravity well of a planet, sending it down onto the surface. Thankfully due to the skill of the command crew, we were able to use the engines to move ourselves over land, narrowly escaping a watery grave."

 imperial_story.0.a: "The Sith-Lord Will Bring Order!"
 imperial_story.0.b: "Tarkin Will Ensure Loyalty!"
 imperial_story.1.t: "Imperial Power"
 imperial_story.1.d: "With Grand Moff Tarkin at the helm of the Executor, the Imperial Army breathes a sigh of relief, as their faith in him as an effective leader is strong. Tarkin has been known to effectively lead the Imperial Navy for years, our men have confidence they will once again see home."
 imperial_story.1.a: "Perhaps there is still a chance."
 imperial_story.2.t: "Imperial Power"
 imperial_story.2.d: "With Lord Vader at the helm of the Executor, conquest of this world is inevitable. The Imperial Army Troopers under our command are noticeably anxious about this, knowing full well the atrocities they will be committing in the name of Vader as well as the mass assaults, knowing that many will never see home again."
 imperial_story.2.a: "Let's hope we survive this."
 imperial_story.3.t: "Star Chart Misallignment"
 imperial_story.3.d: "In attempts to map our current position, our Navigation Officers have been entirely stumped as to our location in the galaxy. Our course was due to take us from Kuat Drive Yards to Fondor. By our Navigations’ best guess, we’ve somehow overshot our hyperspace route and went into the Unknown Regions; however no star charts come even close to our predicted location."
 imperial_story.3.a: "Where ARE we?"
 imperial_story.4.t: "Reconstruction Discovery"
 imperial_story.4.d: "During our examination of the wreckage of our ship, several inconsistencies were found by Imperial Engineers. It appears that our ships shield generators were incomplete, moreso the relativistic shield generators found on all hyperspace capable ships were found to be entirely inadequate for a vessel of our size. Further investigation must be taken before we make any hasty conclusions, as the results could be drastic."
 imperial_story.4.a: "This can't be good."
 imperial_story.5.t: "Realization"
 imperial_story.5.d: "With the shielding of the ship being inadequate, by our best calculations we are somewhere between 13 and 15 million lightyears from the nearest recognizable galaxy. Even then, they are distorted. It seems as if years have passed, they look like our projections estimate that they would thousands of years from now.  This is obviously...unfathomable. This means that we will never see our homes again, and that even if we did return home, it has been over a thousand years since we left. Everything is gone."
 imperial_story.5.a: "Hide the Truth"
 imperial_story.5.b: "General Announcement"
 imperial_story.6.t: "Hide the Truth"
 imperial_story.6.d: "The truth is too much, it would destroy the morale of every crewman of the ship from trooper to admiral. We must suppress it, a task that won’t be easy as we took no precautions; we hadn’t expected the results to be so drastic. Most navigation officers, as well as their aides and superiors know of what has transpired."
 imperial_story.6.a: "Ignorance is bliss"
 imperial_story.7.t: "General Announcement"
 imperial_story.7.d: "It only seems fair that we share what we’ve learned with all Imperials, as every single one of us are affected equally; we are all stranded. This will obviously depress many, and we may even see men break down entirely. This is the reality of our situation now, everything we once knew is gone."
 imperial_story.7.a: "We must face this together"
 imperial_story.8.t: "Spreading Rumors"
 imperial_story.8.d: "Rumors have been spreading amongst every facet of the Imperial Hierarchy, some say we’ve been caught in a wormhole, others say we’ve gone back in time, some are the truth. These most likely originated with our Junior Officers, who were the most informed of our predicament. We must address the concerns of the men, as anymore waiting will only make it seems as though we’re hiding the truth."
 imperial_story.8.a: "Address the Situation"
 imperial_story.9.t: "The Great Depression"
 imperial_story.9.d: "A great depression has spread among our ranks, reasonably so. Men sit in base camps not performing their duties, laying in barracks remembering times long gone. Officers give no orders, drinking themselves to death; even our general staff walk in a haze, inefficiently delegating tasks and overseeing reconstruction."
 imperial_story.9.a: "The Situation is Dire."
 imperial_story.10.t: "The Aftermath"
 imperial_story.10.d: "The Imperial Hierarchy is crumbling, with orders not being followed and lower officers and other Admirals and Generals deciding to follow through with their own ideas rather than that of the Senior Officers. Something must swiftly be done, or else what territory we have may be split apart."
 imperial_story.10.a: "Something Must Be Done!"
 imperial_story.11.t: "Tarkin's Plan"
 imperial_story.11.d: "Wilhuff Tarkin is a master of propaganda, able to manipulate the fear and hatred harbored within a person and turn it against whatever may be useful. Tarkin’s plan involves stoking Elitism amongst the men, waging a war against the planet to begin another Empire, one to last a thousand years, conquering an unconquered galaxy in desperate need of a strong central hand. This will obviously anger the natives within our army."
 imperial_story.11.a: "A Thousand Year Empire"
 imperial_story.12.t: "Vader's Plan"
 imperial_story.12.d: "Darth Vader, feared and respected, demands loyalty from his subordinates. He is the only force-user on this world, and through a vast display of power to all Imperials he shall ensure loyalty from all. The first act of the plan is to ensure the purity of the Imperial Army, ensuring only true Imperials are allowed to hold any significant amount of power. The natives will learn to fear what all Imperials already know."
 imperial_story.12.a: "The Power of the Dark Side"
 imperial_story.13.t: "Vader's War"
 imperial_story.13.d: "Darth Vader intends to show our men that despite being the only Imperials remaining, we are still Imperials. We carry the torch of the Empire, and must begin again; forming an Empire capable of the grandeur of the Empire of old and conquering not only this world, but spreading amongst the stars once again."
 imperial_story.13.a: "The Empire Lives On"
 imperial_story.14.t: "Yularen Comes Forward"
 imperial_story.14.d: "Colonel Wullf Yularen is a well respected man among the Imperial Armed Forces, the average trooper looks up to him as a guiding hand and even tempered leader. He has quickly risen as a figurehead for the growing movement of troopers banding together for more representation in our hierarchy, a worrying development."
 imperial_story.14.a: "Another Problem to Worry About."
 imperial_story.15.t: "Soviet Defectors"
 imperial_story.15.d: "A group of defectors from The Soviet Union to our north have turned to us, pledging their allegiance to the Empire in return for shelter. Skilled personnel are in short supply, accepting their offer is quite lucrative; the Marshal known as Mikhail Tukhachevsky is a particularly skilled individual."
 imperial_story.15.a: "Perhaps He Can Help Us"
 imperial_story.15.b: "We Already Have Enough Problems!"
 imperial_story.16.t: "War is a Success!"
 imperial_story.16.d: "Our plan of conquest has been a success, revitalizing faith in the Empire amongst the men of the Executor. They have faith once again that all is not lost, and that while we are never going to see home again, we can create a home. The natives, however, are becoming nervous about our renewed ambition."
 imperial_story.16.a: "Victory For The Empire!"
 imperial_story.17.t: "War is a Failure!"
 imperial_story.17.d: "Our plan of conquest has failed, the men have lost their faith in the Senior Officers of the Executor to maintain order and restore the Empire. Several splinter groups have already formed, led by various admirals and generals all wanting to reforge the Empire in their own image. Our own troopers no longer follow orders, and march behind the banner of Yularen, while the natives rise behind Mikhail Tuchakevsky; the Junior Officer Corps have taken the Outer Regions for themselves. The Empire is falling, we must swiftly crack the whip and reorder ourselves before it is gone for good."
 imperial_story.17.a: "Collapse of the Empire"
 imperial_story.18.t: "Communist Insurgents"
 imperial_story.18.d: "The communists we've protected have decided to rise up against out supposed tyranny amongst the free peoples of the middle-east! We can either submit to their demands and form a new socialist state or try to fight a three way civil war."
 imperial_story.18.a: "A People's Republic"
 imperial_story.18.b: "The Empire Will Fight"


 imperial.0.t: "Survey Complete!"
 imperial.0.d: "The desert troopers have returned from their survey and have made a disturbing discovery. The area in which the ship crash landed is surrounded by numerous buildings and may have been a city. There is no telling how the survivors may react to us destroying their homes so measures must be taken. We can try to save the survivors and persuade them that we were shot down by a neighboring nation and put the blame on them. The alternative would be to execute the remaining survivors and keep our 'landing' secret which would also allows us to harvest the resources of the area without restriction. "
 imperial.0.a: "Maintain Secrecy"
 imperial.0.b: "Recruit the Local Populace"
 imperial.1.t: "Investigation of the Signal"
 imperial.1.d: "The signal is coming from a piece of radar equipment that split off when we crashed. It's location is a few miles off to the west of a local town. Recovering the component of the ship would be near impossible without risking exposure. The town itself has factories we could use to help reconstruct our ship but would risk us going to war with the nation protecting it. An alternative would be to recover the radar part at night, but would risk us being held back in our reconstruction."
 imperial.1.a: "Attack Protocol"
 imperial.1.b: "Stealth Protocol"
 imperial.2.t: "Construction Zone"
 imperial.2.d: "We can command our droids to scavenge the area for pieces of the ship, allowing us to recycle the material for more droids. This would speed up the process in the long-run.\n\n Alternatively, we can use those materials to create more weapons and stick with the droids we have now."
 imperial.2.a: "More Droids"
 imperial.2.b: "More Weapons"
 imperial.3.t: "Leadership"
 imperial.3.d: "Our situation requires leadership and the one who takes the mantle will determine our course. Darth Vader has his 501st legion to keep order around the ship, but could also be using it for conquest if he were on the front. Tarkin has many connections with the officers and can more easily persuade them to take on tasks but is a brilliant strategist on the battlefield. Who will be the leader for this expedition?"
 imperial.3.a: "The Sith-Lord Will Bring Order!"
 imperial.3.b: "Tarkin Will Ensure Loyalty!"
 imperial.4.t: "The Empire Invites Turkey"
 imperial.4.d: "We've stopped hearing from Iraq and Saudi Arabia for a while now and we weren't sure why, now we know. A group of men outfitted in strange white armor approached the capital. They claim to be following orders from an entity known as the 'Imperial Provisional Government of Earth'. The Imperials are offering us an invitation to their 'Galactic Empire' in exchange for full cooperation. However, based on what we know of Iraq and Saudi Arabia, they aren't coming in peace. There will surely be resistance against the idea of us submitting to a foreign nation we haven't heard of until now."
 imperial.4.a: "There is security within the Empire. Join."
 imperial.4.b: "Turkey is a Sovereign Nation of Earth. Resist."
 imperial.5.t: "Rebellious Populace"
 imperial.5.d: "We've picked up rumours that there is an ongoing resistance to our expansion. Despite us clearly winning the war against them, the people of the recently conquered territories still show signs of rebellion.\n\nWe can choose to ignore these rebellious actions or clamp down on them. If we ignore them for too long, it'll become harder to regain control.\n\nOur popularity with the people must remain high otherwise we'll be more vulnerable to said actions. The more stability we have, the less of an impact they have."
 imperial.5.a: "Acknowledged."
 imperial.5.b: "They can't do anything to us."
 imperial.6.t: "Rebel Organization!"
 imperial.6.d: "The rebels are always working against us in order to overthrow our government. We believe that they may strike soon and should work towards counteracting said acts.\n\nHaving a Secret Police will make containing this easier."
 imperial.6.a: "We cannot have internal forces working against us!"
 imperial.6.b: "They aren't to be taken seriously..."
 imperial.7.t: "The Empire Invites Iran"
